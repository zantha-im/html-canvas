    <div>
      <h5><strong>Initial Impression</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>Campfire and Savoury Smoke</strong></em><br>
      The opening note is a distinct, dry, and clean smokiness immediately calling to mind a <strong>campfire</strong> or barbecue. This robust start is supported by savoury, aromas reminiscent of <strong>paprika, smoked meat, and oak</strong>, providing an intense, outdoorsy feel. The gentle medicinal casing (eucalyptus, menthol, Sicilian lemon) is only faintly present, allowing the smoke to lead.</p>

      <h5><strong>Mid-Stage Transition</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>The Rustic Leaf Base</strong></em><br>
      The strong smoky aromas transition to reveal the high-quality tobacco base (Kentucky Dark Fired). Beneath the smoke, other dry wood elements emerge, along with faint hints of <strong>lightly toasted bread, wheat, and molasses</strong>. The overall profile is <em>complex-rustic</em>, balancing the dry, woody smoke with the natural, slightly sweet leaf base.</p>

      <h5><strong>Base Notes</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>Earthy Punch</strong></em><br>
      The experience settles into a long-lasting, consistent profile with a prominent <strong>earthy punch</strong> and the characteristic bite of dark fired tobacco. Nicotine delivery is a smooth medium to high, providing a pure and satisfying pinch while the schmalzler nose feel ensures a comfortable experience.</p>

      <h5><strong>Finish</strong></h5>
      <p><strong>Well-Structured and Enduring</strong><br>
      Tholtan delivers a sustained presence in the nose. The smoke never entirely overshadows the natural leaf, ensuring the aromas remain in proportion for the duration of the pinch. The finish is characterized by an enduring, dry wood and autumnal leaf profile, making this a satisfying and highly recommended snuff for lovers of natural, smoky heritage blends.</p>
