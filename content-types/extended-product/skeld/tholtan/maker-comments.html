      <h4>SKëLD - Tholtan - The Medicated Schmalzer of the North</h4>
      <p>Sir Johnny's philosophy for <em>Tholtan</em> is rooted in the essential maxim of the old snuff makers: the quality of the tobacco blend is absolutely crucial. This blend, categorized as a medicinal schmalzer within the Northern European collection, is crafted from exclusively the finest <strong>Kentucky Dark Fired</strong> tobacco. Inspired by the sophistication of Regency London and the lost excellence of heritage recipes, Tholtan is designed to be a strong, rich, and exquisite snuff. Sir Johnny ensures that the subtle casings of eucalyptus, menthol, and Sicilian lemon are applied gently—only to enhance the natural, earthy flavour of the dark fired leaf, never to distract from its inherent quality.</p>
      <p>The result of months of careful experimentation, Tholtan is a testament to the maker's dedication to quality and time, which is necessary to establish a balance of complex flavours. This unique demi gros blend offers a robust, rustic appearance with its irregular grind and moderate moisture. It delivers a powerfully satisfying, meaty bite and a potent dose of nicotine, driven by the deeply smoky and earthy core of the fire-cured Kentucky. Tholtan is an artisan expression of heritage, appealing directly to connoisseurs who value the purity and power of natural, well-aged tobacco.</p>
