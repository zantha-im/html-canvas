      <p>The name <strong>SKëLD - Tholtan</strong> is rooted in the Viking-Manx heritage of the Isle of Man. <strong>SKëLD</strong> loosely translates to <strong>Shield</strong>, perfectly aligning with the range's strapline: "<strong>Some things are worth defending.</strong>" A <em>Tholtan</em> refers to the rugged, ruined family dwellings scattered across the island's remote countryside. This name grounds the snuff in a sense of protective strength, enduring history, and the resilience of the Manx people.</p>

      <h4>Sir Johnny Scott, The Revivalist of Artisan Craft</h4>
      <p>Sir Johnny Scott, 5th Baronet, has dedicated himself to the art of crafting pure, strong, and exquisite snuffs, reviving the exacting standards of traditional European artisans. His ambition was not to copy, but to forge new, powerful blends using the finest ingredients, driven by his deep appreciation for the history of tobacco. Tholtan stands as a powerful defense of quality in an age of mass production, embodying the maxim that the quality of the tobacco blend is the foundation of all excellence.</p>
      <p>Philosophically, Tholtan seeks to capture the spirit of the Viking-Manx shield wall—the enduring strength and rustic integrity of heritage craft. Classified as a medicated schmalzer, this blend of Dark Fired Kentucky is not merely a product; it is a successful act of perseverance. The rustic appearance, the smoky aromas, and the potent nicotine delivery reinforce Tholtan's connection to the land and the simple, profound satisfaction of strong, uncompromising snuff.</p>
