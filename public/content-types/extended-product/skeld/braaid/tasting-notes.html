      <p>SKëLD - Braaid is characterised by its unique combination of dark leaf tobacco and Northern European grain spirits, creating a smooth, complex, and dessert-like aroma. Its balanced grind and moisture ensure it is exceptionally easy to take, making it a study in elevated snuff experience.</p>
      
      <h5><strong>Initial Impression</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>Spirit and Spice</strong></em><br>
      The opening note is a prominent scent of <strong>alcohol</strong> (Akvavit/Kummel), accompanied by a distinct, complex herbal bill. The most discernible top notes are <strong>caraway seeds, dill, and cardamom</strong>, with a hint of anise and fennel. This initial burst is surprisingly smooth and awakens the nose, presenting a strong, yet appealing, spirit-infused profile.</p>
      
      <h5><strong>Mid-Stage Transition</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>The Sweet Leaf Core</strong></em><br>
      As the alcohol notes gently fade, a rich, underlying sweetness comes forward. This is akin to <strong>honeyed bread, biscuit, and rich creamy chocolate liqueur</strong>, suggesting the natural sweetness of the Straight Virginia and Agonya Turkish leaf. A dark fruit note, like <strong>date or raisin</strong>, emerges, balancing the herbaceous spice.</p>
      
      <h5><strong>Base Notes</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>Smooth Tobacco and Complexity</strong></em><br>
      The complex herb bill softens, leaving the caraway, dill, and cardamom to merge seamlessly with the tobacco base. The three-leaf blend (Turkish, Burley, Virginia) offers a clean, smooth, tobacco-forward experience, with subtle hints of vanilla and slight nuttiness. The nicotine releases quickly and sustains slowly over time.</p>
      
      <h5><strong>Finish</strong></h5>
      <p><em><strong>Dessert-Like and Enduring</strong></em><br>
      Braaid leaves an enjoyable, long-lasting sweetness of honey, dark fruit, and bread in the nose. The finish is smooth, comfortable, and satisfying, appealing to both beginners and connoisseurs as an easy-to-use, yet complex and layered, artisan snuff.</p>
