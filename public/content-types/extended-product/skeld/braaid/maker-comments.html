      <h4>Braaid - The Spirit-Infused Revival</h4>
      <p>Sir Johnny Scott's philosophy for SKëLD - Braaid centres on achieving a unique flavour profile where spirit and leaf co-exist harmoniously. This blend, categorised within the Northern European collection, is crafted from a fine-milled composition of <strong>Agonya Turkish, Malawi Burley, and Straight Virginia</strong> leaf. Sir Johnny's mission is to use only the finest ingredients to forge blends of exquisite quality, standing as a defence against mass-produced snuff. Braaid is a tribute to this commitment, achieving a strong, smooth delivery.</p>
      <p>The crucial element of Braaid is the casing: a blend of Mentzendorf Kummel and <strong>Akvavit</strong>, the national spirit of Scandinavia. The spirit is carefully applied to elevate the natural sweetness and complexity of the leaf blend, rather than merely flavouring it. The caraway, cardamom, and fennel top notes are designed to awaken the nose while allowing the dark fruit, bready character of the tobacco to shine through. The dedication to quality and time results in a balanced, enjoyable study in the use of spirits to elevate the artisan snuff experience.</p>
