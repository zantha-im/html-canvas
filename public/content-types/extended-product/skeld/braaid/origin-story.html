      <h4>Braaid - Forged in the Isle of Man</h4>
      <p>A name born from the Isle of Man's most sacred ground, <strong>Braaid</strong> embodies the island's dual soul. Named for the ancient Manx place meaning <strong>"Breast of a Hill,"</strong> this site is a physical testament to the Viking Age, a unique archaeological site where Norse longhouses stand alongside the roundhouses of the native Celtic population. Like the location, this blend is <strong>forged</strong> in the spirit of this unique co-existence—a tribute to the strength and seamless merging of two great peoples into one Manx nation.</p>
      <p>Sir Johnny Scott, 5th Baronet, has dedicated his life to natural history and uncompromising craft. His motivation for creating snuffs is rooted in the belief that true excellence must be forged with the finest ingredients and time, upholding the forgotten standards of traditional European artisans. His journey began out of a frustration with the decline of heritage quality, leading him to experiment until he achieved the strong, rich, exquisite results he desired.</p>
      <p>Philosophically, Braaid embodies the island's dual soul and the theme of seamless merging. The blend itself—combining Agonya Turkish, Malawi Burley, and Straight Virginia leaf, cased with the Scandinavian spirit Akvavit—is a tribute to this unique co-existence. It is forged in the spirit of two great peoples blending into one Manx nation, resulting in a complex, layered product that is both naturally dessert-like and tobacco-forward, a potent symbol of enduring heritage.</p>
